"# Mozzi-FIlter-With-One-Pot" 
From the Arduino Mozzi Library example.  This version has one added pot for the LPF frequency.  

This might help someone implement pots into their code.  

You should convert from the map function to Mozzi's own AutoMap for speed.  

I have another example of this code with two pots added, then with the automap function added.  

Go take a look!
